I spent the last week following alongside a JavaScript Mastery tutorial whereby we rebuilt a banking app which was pre-designed by [OneWeekWonders](https://www.oneweekwonders.com/). This tutorial was my first time learning about Tailwind and Vite and I learnt so much! 🧠 

A summary of what I learnt: 
- [x] Vite is a new tool, an alternative to CreateReactApp which can initialise a React App
- [x] Downloading extention ES7+ React in VSCode enabled me to create component templates using 'rafce' within seconds! 🤯 
- [x] In VSCode, using alt to multi-select and cmd + arrowkey to multi add syntax such as self closing tags in the App.js file 
- [x] So much about Tailwind! Using the documentation and a [Tailwind CheatSheet](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet) to understand and add styling to components 📃 
- [x] How to create responsive designs for webs and phone apps in tailwind using the 'sm' and 'md' tags in ClassNames 📱 
- [x] How to create a seperate styling sheet, importing 'styles' and using dynamic string template in className styling to keep code tidy and styling seperate, consistent and uniform 
- [x] How to map over an array of objects inside an array of objects for the Footer element of the app
- [x] Better understanding of UX and how to create web apps which are beautiful, modern and easy 😍 
- [x] How creating a web app with reusable elements can streamline the development process and avoid major blockers when coding! 🔄 
- [x] Best ptactices for 'clean code' 🧼 
- [x] When you are creating a functional component in React which only returns JSX, you can remove the curle braces and the return statement to reduce the lines of code and one level of indentation

❌  Instead of:
```
const Footer = () => {
    return (
        <section>
            Footer
        </section>
    )
}
```

✅  Clean version:
```
const Footer = () => (
    <section>
        Footer
    </section>
  )
```

Overall, I had a great time following this tutorial and learnt so much! I feel super happy to have added TailwindCSS to my tech stack belt and can't wait to use what I've learnt here and apply it to building my portfolio! 🎉
